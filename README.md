# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis.
This analysis was meant to examine the relationship between PyBer rides by fare amount and the type of city in which they're occurring. It also sought to establish any correlation between the number of drivers available and the city type in which they find themselves. 
### Results. 
We can see from the multi-line graph that the urban and suburban city types draw much more in fare amounts than the rural city types, and from the pie charts that were created we can also see that the urban and suburban city types have many more drivers and rides than the rural city type.
### Summary. 
My first recommendation to addresssing the disparity among the city types would be to allocate more drivers to service the rural and suburban regions as opposed to the urban ones, since the data would show that the urban city type is overly serviced already in terms of the number of drivers that they have. My second recommendation would be to have the urban drivers do more ride-sharing to the suburban areas since they would likely be closer along the routes the urban drivers would take, and likewise for the suburban drivers to do the same for the rural routes.
